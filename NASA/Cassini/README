This version of the Cassini Orbiter model is from the original Inventor format model:

http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/models/models/cassini.iv.gz

(Note: I think the https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/cassini-assy model is probably a
conversion from this original.)

Cassini Orbiter, 300,000 primitives
Includes orbiter from CAD models. Accurate (to a fault) except no
thermal blanketing is shown (this would cover most of the central
structure of the spacecraft).


Conversion notes:

In 2021 I finally found a conversion path that extracted the data into a
useful form:

The ubuntu package inventor-clients has a tool ivcat which can go from binary
inventor to ascii inventor:

ivcat cassini.iv > ascii.iv

Then, the tool ivcon from https://sourceforge.net/projects/ivcon-tl/ can deal
with the ASCII form of the IV file.

./ivcon ascii.iv ascii.obj

The obj file was then converted into BRL-CAD (via the gcv assimp importer) and
post processed.  Vertex fusing, followed by bot splitting to break up individual
pieces to try and separate the original single mesh into per-part meshes.

The odds are excellent that this over-split the mesh, producing separate pieces
as a consequence of flaws in the original mesh, but in many cases the results
seem to be reasonable.  The current cassini.g file is at least a good starting
point for further work.

Given the difficulty of recovering the data, three copies are preserved here:

cassini.iv.gz - the original space.jpl.nasa.gov file
cassini.obj.gz - the OBJ conversion produced as described above
cassini.g - the post-processed OBJ file with regions and color randomization applied
