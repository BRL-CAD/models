     Description: This is a sphere level-of-detail model, originally described
                  and facetized in BRL-CAD using progressively smaller
                  relative tolerance settings, and then exporting to STL via
                  bot_dump.  The model is non-hierarchical triangle mesh data.
                  The facetizations are topologically and geometrically solid.
