     Description: This is a 1997 Nissan Truck model, created circa 2010 from
                  direct measurements and modeled using Rhino3D and BRL-CAD.
                  An X-Station System was used to scan 4425 data points. 
                  Points were imported into Rhino (v4.0 4b) where principal
                  modeling used reference points, sketches, and hand 
                  measurements.  Additional modeling in BRL-CAD (7.16.7)
                  replaced lines and with BRL-CAD 'pipe' entities along with
                  CSG subtractions to eliminate overlaps.

                  The model is topologically and geometrically solid.
